# Building a small scale autonomous driving car using machine learning. 

Autonomous cars have been a topic of increasing interest recently as many companies are actively developing related hardware and software technologies towards fully autonomous driving capability with no human intervention. Machine learning have been successfully applied in various perception and control tasks in recent years and they are beginning to see applications in autonomous driving. From Tesla Model S to Google Waymo to Uber to major auto makers. They are using machine learning for aaplications like vision based real-time obstacle detection and avoidance. More recently, researchers are investigating deep learning end-to-end control of cars and other robots.

This project is based on the open source [DIY Robocars](https://diyrobocars.com/) project so first of all, a huge thank you to that community and its contributors.

What I am going to build is a self-driving car at a 1/16 scale, a low-cost autonomous car testbed, which is based on the state-of-the-art end-to-end deep learning with the goal of lowering the economic and safety-related barriers to the research in autonomous cars.  The overall cost of the project will be around £250, depending on where you purchase parts and how good you are at shoplifting.

The DIY Robocar will navigate itself around a track autonomously without any input from its owner, using computer vision and machine learning running on a tiny onboard computer, the Raspberry Pi. The network receives an image  frame  from  a  single  forward  looking  camera  as  input and  generates  a  predicted  steering  angle  value  as  output  at each  control  period  in real-time.  The  network  has  9  layers, about  27  million  connections  and  250  thousand  parameters (weights).  The  network  architecture  is  identical  to  that  of NVIDIA’s  DAVE-2  self-driving  car,  which  uses  a  much more  powerful  computer  (Drive  PX  computer)  than  a Raspberry  Pi. 

I'll look at each of the following steps in turn:

1. The overall goals
2. Hardware
3. Software
4. Training the model
5. Performance analysis and visualization
6. Racing

## 1. Overall goals

The main goal of this project is to focus on the learning experience as a whole. The objective is to make and race pro-level autonomous car on a budget. That means it's smaller than the regular car (from go-kart size, down to 1/16th scale) and can be used indoors.

But just because it's small and cheap doesn't mean that it can't run real autonomous car software on them. As a matter of fact, both the Robocar and the real autonomous driving cars like the Google Waymo, Tesla, etc  are both on the kind of thesame continuum. They both use thesame technology, from Tensorflow to OpenCV to sensors and the cloud. But the cost of the robocar is roughly $200 while that of Google Waymo? $150,000?

**Why do we do this?** We do this because we always do things they don't, we crash all the time and that helps us to iterate really fast and nobody gets hurt. Secondly, we race wheel-to-wheel and that is something no autonomous driving car manufacturer does. We race wheel-to-wheel every weekend. This is how some of the best automobile makers innovate. They race wheel-to-wheel. 

Rather than doing all processing on-board, this DIY Robocar tends to transmit the data from its on-board sensors (cameras, sonar, lidar, radar, GPS or whatever else I have) via Wifi to a laptop that runs pro-grade AI and robotics software, including TensorFlow, ROS and the rest of the Udacity Self-Driving Car nanodegree toolchain.

The Exceed Magnet as recommended on [DIY Robocars](https://diyrobocars.com/) is basically sold out in the UK, so I spent some good time trying to figure out an alternative. From ebay to aliexpress to amazon to hobbyking untill I found the 1/16 truck chassis. You may be lucky to find one if you carry out your search deligently but most RC cars with the almost ready to ride (ARR) will work just fine.
Here's what I came up with;

There are two models selling with the same chassis. The AAR version ships from Europe, other variants may not. 

Here's the marketing video;

The Raspberry Pi model 3 is the central computer of the Robocar. Robocar uses Model B ( A1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core ARMv8 CPU, 1GB RAM), a small but powerful computer. The raspberry Pi was chosen not only because it is affordable but also because it is a representation of today's mainstream embedded low-end multicore platforms found in smartphones and other embedded devices.

Next steps: 
- **Mounting:** Obviously the stock 3D printed parts are not going to fit, so will need to improvise. I am considering using a cardboard. I want to make a design with flexibility for mounting more sensors and also good compactment for placing the power bank. I will wait until the car arrives to make measurements. 


Finally my RC car and other hardware parts arrived except the battery charger which was shipped all the way from Hong Kong. This is one thing you should consider when ordering from Hobbyking. They have multiple warehouses across the world and they may ship from anyone that has the parts if the one closest to you has run out of stock. 

The figure below shows the various parts of the RC car I ordered

[![parts](https://github.com/udohsolomon/Robocars/blob/master/Images/parts.jpg)]()

Obviously I don't have the 3D printed parts so the best I could do was to improvised. I used cardboards instead for prototyping the structure. They are lightweight, easy to use and most importantly get the job done. However, for pro racing competitions I would consider using the 3D printed prototype. 

Here is the picture of the assembled robocar in its naked form.

### Electrical and Electronics systems 

The figures below show the electrical system of the robocar with my little modification.

As stated earlier, the Exceed Magnet was out of stock in Amazon Europe and I settled for the Bad Bug instead after extensive research for alternative RC car. The main difference in chassis, compared to the Exceed Magnet, is the battery pack. In this case, the double 1800mAh 2s 20c batteries store significantly more energy, but critically, also have a higher discharge rate, which is represented by the **C-Rating**; 

```Max Current Draw = Capacity x C-Rating```

Secondly, the Bad Bug car has twice the voltage rating compared to the Exceed Magnet. These two factors lead the car to have **way too much power** to make any real autonomous driving tests possible in this early phase. 

The table below lists the key parameters, and the third entry in the table is the current solution for de-powering the chassis: removing one battery from the power bank.

| Variant                              | Technology | Voltage <br> [V] | Capacity <br> [mAH] | Discharge <br> [C-Rating] | Configuration <br>[S] |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Exceed Magnet** | NiMh       | 7.2              | 1100                | Much less than 20C        | ?                     |
| **HobbyKing Bad Bug**           <br>        | LiPo       | 14.4             | 3600                | More than 20C             | 2S * 2 = **4S1P**     |
| **My Alternate Bad Bug**    <br>   | LiPo       | 7.2              | 1800                | 20C                       | 2S * 2 = **2S1P**     |

This is therefore my current solution. Of course, I can put the second battery in parallel instead of removing it completely from the circuit. 

**Some few notes on the hardware** 

* The portable iMuto 20000 mAh power bank charger is far too overkill for this project. I later found out that anything above 5000 mAh will do just fine. 
* The battery capacity I ordered for is also an overkill but I had to improvised and did some hacking with the electrical system to reduced the it by **50%**.


## 3. Software

The software installation was pretty straight forward, thanks to the donkeycar documentation and the USB disk image. Here's a quick summary of the process, refer to the donkey page for details.

1. Install software to the Raspberry Pi
   * a. Write the project disk image to the SD card
   * b. Write WiFi access to ```/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf```
   * c. Make hostname as ```d2```
   * d. Power on rPi, have a usb keyboard and monitor handy for troubleshooting unless you know how to hack the wifi router to get the rPi IP address
   * e. Test: Ping d2.local 
2. Installing software on the host
   * a. Tensorflow and Keras
   * b. Clone the source for the 'donkeycar' project, the python code for running the vehicle
3. Testing
   * a. ```ping d2.local ```
   * b. SSH into the RPi ```ssh pi@d2.local```
   * c. Git-pull the donkeycar repo
   * d. Start a new car software by template ```donkey createcar --template donkey2 --path ~/d2```

### Running

With the hardware and software set, the normal procedure becomes;
1. ```source activate drive``` environment in linux
2. ```ssh pi@d2.local```
3. Run the ```python manage.py drive``` command to start the car and web service
4. Access the car at ```d2:8887```

### Calibration

The PWM signal is controlled in the ```config.py``` file on the Pi. Two 
parameters influence the throttle signal - the calibrated maxium, which I set at
390, and the joystick throttle multiplier, which I incrementally increased from 
0.50 to 0.95, searching for the **minimum** speed for my current hardware configuration. Detailed documentation of the calibration is found in the donkey documentary site.

Here is the summary of the configuration parameters; 

```
#THROTTLE
THROTTLE_CHANNEL = 0
THROTTLE_FORWARD_PWM = 390
THROTTLE_STOPPED_PWM = 370
THROTTLE_REVERSE_PWM = 350
JOYSTICK_MAX_THROTTLE = 0.95

```
The PWM for steering left turn was set to 420 while that of the right turn was set to 290. 

```
#STEERING
STEERING_CHANNEL = 1
STEERING_LEFT_PWM = 420
STEERING_RIGHT_PWM = 290

```

### Controller

Getting the controller to work over blutooth at first was a struggle, somehow I managed to figured it out, thanks for the concise documentation still at the donkey site. 
After a few hours spent going through all the commands several times, I somehow got the controller to communicate via BlueTooth with the car.

To test the controller, I connected it directly via usb to the raspberry Pi. Running the bluetoothctl utility gave immediate results;

```
pi@d2 ~ $ bluetoothctl
[NEW] Controller 58:91:CF:1C:30:17 d2 [default]
[NEW] Device FC:62:B9:3B:B3:B5 PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller
```
This provided the necessary verifcation to show that the controller was functional and the correct model.
